# â€ŠðŸ›’ Online Shop with JS

Fully functional web application developed as a final Javascript course project for Coderhouse. The application is designed to simulate an e-commerce store, allowing users to browse and purchase products in a simple and intuitive way.

The homepage features a clean and modern design, with a featured product section and a variety of product categories to choose from. Users can easily order products by price or name.

Once a user finds a product they are interested in, they can add the product to their shopping cart. The shopping cart functionality is seamlessly integrated into the application, allowing users to easily add or remove products and update quantities. Added products will be stored in LocalStorage as a stringified JSON, so the cart won't be empty the next time the user open the website.

I've learned advanced functions and one-line events of ECMAScript6 which help me a lot to optimize my code and to develope on a faster way.

Also, I've discover a pop-up library for Javascript called Swal, Swal is really easy-to-use and well optimized, so maybe, It's a good opton for your next project.
